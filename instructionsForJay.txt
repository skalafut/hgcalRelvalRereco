Instructions for submitting jobs to re-reco existing HGCal relval samples with new reconstruction code
With the exception of making the output file directory in step 1, all of these instructions should
be carried out in this directory, 'hgcalRelvalRereco', which was cloned from github.  

1. setup a directory where you want the output files to be stored.  Open the file run_reReco_TEMP.csh and
   change 'AbsPathToOutDir' to the absolute path name of the directory you created.

2. open reReco_TEMP, the condor job submission file template, and change 'INCOMPLETEPATH' to the absolute
   path name of the directory where you cloned the github directory 'hgcalRelvalRereco'.  

3. checkout the CMSSW release in which the data sample was produced, and cd to the src/ directory, and cmsenv.
   Checkout the new repository of reco code from github using
       git cms-merge-topic userName:branchName

4. execute 'scram b -j 8' to compile the new reconstruction code.

5. bundle all of the compiled directories into a single .tar file.  The name
   of the tar file should indicate the CMSSW release and the date on which the
   reco code was checked out.  Something like forSLHC23_Jan_15.tar works well.
   Move this .tar file up two directories.

6. cd two directories up and open the file cmsswSetup.sh.  Change relName to
   the appropriate CMSSW release.  Run the cmsswSetup.sh script.

7. Open the step3_TEMP python file created by cmsswSetup.sh.  Insert the
   xrootd file names which you want to reprocess.  See the python file named
   old_step3...py for an example.  Put each file name on its own line, and
   comment out each file name in this python file.

8. Open the file makeRunFiles.sh.  Change tarName to the name of the .tar
   directory created in step 5.  Change relName to match relName set in step 6.
   Set the constant value added to i in the declaration of 'line' such that line
   is equal to the line number of the first file name in the step3 python file
   when i equals zero.  Adjust the max value of i such that all of the input
   files are uncommented by the for loop. 

9. Open the file submitRerecoJobs.sh, and increase the max value of i to match
   the max value of i set in makeRunFiles.sh.  Adjust the disk space and memory
   requests if running over zero PU input files. 

10. execute makeRunFiles.sh.

11. make a proxy of your grid certificate.

12. execute submitRerecoJobs.sh.
